-Implement DPMS? (cf. xf86DPMS.c) (useful on XDarwin?) else: --disable-dpms
-Problem with changing screen depth: IOFBGetDisplayModeInformation() gives a depth of 8, while dfb->depth=24!!!???
-shadowInit()??? and don't forget dfb->framebuffer = dfb->shadowPtr; what is the use of shadow?? (It seems that pScreen->CreatePixmap() isn't defined!!)
-In xfiokit.c: fix ev_unlock() + ev_lock() + manage tablets? + add other functionalities =) (look at X11Application.m)
-Bug scrolling (in the web browser, the scrolling is strange (it looks like it is caused by the fact that the Delta is an integer (??) !!)
-DarwinModeChangePointerControl: FIXME: We currently ignore the threshold in ctrl->threshold
-DarwinModeChangePointerControl for DarwinTabletProc too?
-Use a better way of storing cursor infos (not in DarwinFramebufferRec…)??
-When launching XDarwin directly after powering up the computer, the trackpad "touch clic" doesn't work (we must clic physically)
-Graphics accélération -> nautilus windows are ugly when moving them quickly =( (opengl, glx?)
-GLX!
-Screen bounds -> setting height and width in multi-screen
-Add functionalities: computer sleep, brightness (keyboard too), sound keys, fans correctly managed by the kernel alone?
-IOFB_ARBITRARY_SIZE_CURSOR ->for greater cursors in hardware mode!!
